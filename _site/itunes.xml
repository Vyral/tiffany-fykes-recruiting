        <description>

The very first thing members of my team do when they get a listing is work on staging the home with the seller. We make sure the seller knows what projects need to be done, including repairs and packing up excess belongings—no one’s home is perfectly ready for the market if they’re not staging it first.

Once we’ve established a list of projects for the seller to complete, we’ll have an idea of how long it will take to finish that list, which then allows us to make a plan for the agent’s side of things. While the seller is working inside the house, we’re outside pre-marketing the property to make sure that when the house goes on the MLS, it’s not the first time people have heard about it.

“If you start your marketing only when the house goes on the MLS, you’re already behind.”

On our side, we first look for agents who we believe have buyers who would be interested in our seller’s home. That means we’ll call other agents who have had listings in the neighborhood in the last one to three months, since that means they’ll likely have buyers. If the agents operate in one of our farm areas, we’ll make sure that neighborhood is aware of that listing. Additionally, we’ll put signs and “coming soon” pointers in the seller’s yard about two weeks before it goes live on the market so that passersby know it’s for sale.

We do all this because we’ve found that if you start your marketing only when the house goes on the MLS, you’re already behind and the house will have a greater chance of stagnating on the market, which won’t net your seller any more money.

Once the seller has finished with their list of things to do, we then execute our traditional marketing, which includes putting the home on the MLS, getting professional photos taken, creating internet ads, and more.

If you have any questions about what to do after you land a listing, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.

        <title>How I Keep My Appointments Within Business Hours</title>

        <description>

One of the things I focus on heavily is how to fit my appointments into business work hours. I know that not every showing can necessarily fit into that time frame, but I’ve figured out an easy way to keep almost all of my appointments confined to my working hours. People often ask me how I’m able to manage this, so I’d like to share my simple process with you today.

One of the things I love to provide people with is my appointment-setting script. When setting appointments, I learned that if you don’t give clients any options, they’ll pick whatever is easiest for them. Easiest for them usually winds up being in the evening time.

My initial strategy was to offer my clients a choice of either 1 p.m. or 3 p.m. This worked about 70% of the time, but I would still get people who’d say that those times didn’t work for them; they either wanted a morning or an evening appointment.

“If you don’t give clients any options, they’ll pick whatever is easiest for them.”

So I adjusted my script a little bit and began offering clients an additional choice to meet over lunch. That ended up eliminating 95% of evening appointments.

Now, there are still some people who just cannot make those time frames work. Nurses or police officers, for example, will find it hard to make those appointments since they have such strict schedules. In those cases, I offered to set appointments for 1 p.m. or 3 p.m. on Saturday, since that worked for my home life.

No matter what, be flexible with your script. Give your clients two options to choose from and then an alternative for those who just can’t make your initial options work. That’s how you serve your clients well and maintain your schedule.

If you have any other questions about balancing work and home life or about being an agent in general, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

There are two things we can control with a home listing: price and condition. I’m often asked, “How do I know if my house is overpriced?”

Homes are overpriced as a result of the two areas I mentioned above: It’s an issue with either its price or its condition. To make sure your home isn’t overpriced, its price or condition must change. A change in condition means upgrading the property, such as repainting it or renovating the kitchen. A change in price simply means lowering it so it more closely matches the home’s condition.

“To make sure your home isn’t overpriced, its price or condition must change.”

Here’s how you can tell when your home is overpriced:

1.There have been no showings for three weeks.

2.You have no offers after 10 showings.

When one of these conditions is met, it’s time to consider lowering your price or upgrading your home. If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.

        <title>Which Neighborhood Should You Farm?</title>

        <description>

Running a real estate business involves a lot of community building and marketing to a specific neighborhood.

Realtors call this “farming,” and I recently got a great question on this very subject. Mary in Houston asks, “How should agents choose a neighborhood to farm?”

There are two main questions agents should consider when picking a neighborhood to farm:

1. Does the neighborhood have a good turnover rate? An ideal neighborhood for farming would be one where people actually move semi-frequently. Therefore, aim for neighborhoods with a turnover rate of at least 6%. The bigger the turnover rate a neighborhood has, the better. To determine an area’s turnover rate, compare the number of recent sales versus the total number of homes.

“The bigger the turnover rate a neighborhood has, the better.”

2. Is there already a dominant real estate agent in the neighborhood? When considering this point, remember that any agent who has 15% of the market share for a given neighborhood is considered dominant. Also, if two agents combined have 20% of a neighborhood’s market share, they would be considered dominant, as well. Though it is possible to farm a neighborhood that already has a dominant agent, I personally wouldn’t recommend it.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
