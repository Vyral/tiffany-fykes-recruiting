{% include youtube.html %}If you’re wondering whether to get a real estate coach, here’s my advice.

A common question I receive from real estate agents is whether they should invest in coaching. I always say that you should invest in coaching if you want to grow and do more. If you’re happy with where your business is and have met your goals, you likely don’t need it. However, **if you want to improve, there is always an advantage to having an outside voice pushing and helping you find your full potential.&nbsp;**

Here’s a quick exercise I want you to do as you read this: Raise your hand as high as you can. Now raise it one more inch. You’ll find a way to move your body enough to get your hand a little higher. In a sense, this is what a coach does for you.&nbsp;

Sometimes I talk to my real estate coach about how I want to stop working at a certain time; it’s not always about how to do more, it can be about how to set up your business in such a way as to create the life you want. Sometimes I tell my coach that my monthly goal is to be home with my kids by a certain time each day, so every follow-up conversation with them is about whether I achieved that goal, how I can adjust to accomplish it, how it felt to not accomplish it, etc. **Coaches push you to be more accountable to what you said was crucial to you.**

I don’t think coaching can come too early or too late. However, if you don’t want to grow, there’s no point. Get a coach to if you want help doing things smarter, faster, and more efficiently than you thought was possible.&nbsp;
