How do you present an offer to the listing agent for the best chance of getting it accepted? **How your offer gets accepted actually builds upon the first showing that you do.**

When you are showing a property that you think your buyer is going to be interested in, call or text the listing agent and let them know you’re showing the property, and ask if there are any offers or anything else unique that you need to know. Nobody does that, so it makes you stand out\!

Then, once your buyers are interested, you may already have information on the house. If you need more information about the seller, tell the listing agent your buyer might make an offer, and then ask them about the seller. Try to get the most important piece of information according to the seller. For example, maybe your offer will come in low on price, but you can meet the closing date that’s especially important to them. **That’s going to give you a giant advantage over other offers\!&nbsp;**

Next, send the listing agent a text or email to let them know when you’ve written up an offer on the property with your buyer, so they’ll know to be on the lookout for it. Let the listing agent know your buyer is pre-approved and enthusiastic, but don’t tell them about your buyer’s motivation.

Tip: Outline the offer in the email. Draft that email like you’re talking to the seller because many agents will simply forward that message on to the sellers anyway. Include anything else you want the seller to know. This is essentially pre-negotiating. Avoid saying anything negative about the property or its location, it could make the seller defensive.

In the best scenarios, you don’t want to have a bunch of counteroffers, you want that first offer accepted, so following these guidelines should help that process.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to speak with you\!
