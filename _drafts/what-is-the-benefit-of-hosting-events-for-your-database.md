One of the great things about hosting events for your database is the fact that you get to have so many great conversations with people about the services you provide for them.

To put on a great client event, you first need to **plan an event that your clients would enjoy going to.** It doesn’t need to be expensive; a lot of big agents rent out zoos or movie theaters, which is fine, but those types of expensive events aren’t the only options you have.

Our Popsicle Party this Saturday is an example of a low-key client event you can try. We’ll have a bounce house out in our parking lot, we’ll have a money drawing for a teacher to outfit their classroom for the back-to-school season.

Second, **figure out how to get the word out about your event.** Post fliers on social media, mail postcards, or send out an email to your database to make sure that the maximal number of people see the event advertisement.

Third, **call your database directly and invite them to the event.** Tell them about what a great event it is, let them know you were thinking about them, and emphasize that you’d like to see them there.

Fourth, **talk to the attendees at your event to get their contact information.** This is made easier by hosting a giveaway if you’re marketing to your farm and not just people that you already know.

Fifth, **do a follow-up call with the attendees and show your appreciation for their attendance.** Use the call as an opportunity to touch base on something you’d discussed with them at the event—this shows them that you listened. Then, ask them what real estate needs they have or who they know to contact with their needs. **Be sure to call those who were invited but didn’t attend,** let them know that you missed them at your event, and ask them if they or someone they know has any real estate needs you can assist with.
