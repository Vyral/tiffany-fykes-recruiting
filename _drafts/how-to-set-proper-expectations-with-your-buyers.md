The fall market is big for our business. One of our newer agents asked me recently, “What do I do with the buyers who want to see 30 houses if I’m already working with five of them?” Here’s what I told her.

**Step number one is to set expectations up front.** You need to let your buyers know that most buyers find a home after five or six showings. One of our buyer’s agents, John, puts it like this: *“Sometimes, the very first house that you walk into is the one you’re going to fall in love with. Dol not be afraid of buying the first house you see.”*

**You shouldn’t show more than five to six homes at a time to any buyer.** They won’t be able to compare them as well. At each house, talk to them about how it compares to the others you’ve seen.&nbsp;

Compare and contrast properties until you pick out the best of the bunch. Save the home that you think they’ll love the most in the end. Then you can narrow it down. If you don’t advise them house by house, they won’t remember what they liked or didn't like throughout the day.&nbsp;

In our market, buyers don’t have a ton of time to think. Encourage them, prepare them to make a good decision, and then they'll be ready to buy the perfect home when it comes up.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
