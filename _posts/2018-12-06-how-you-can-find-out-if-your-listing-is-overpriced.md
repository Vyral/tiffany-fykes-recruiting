There are two things we can control with a home listing: price and condition. I’m often asked, “How do I know if my house is overpriced?”

Homes are overpriced as a result of the two areas I mentioned earlier: It’s an issue with either its price or its condition. To make sure your home isn’t overpriced, **its price or condition must change.** A change in condition means upgrading the property, such as repainting the home or renovating the kitchen. A change in price simply means lowering it so it more closely matches the home’s condition.

**Here’s how you can tell when your home is overpriced:**

1. There have been no showings for three weeks.

2. You have no offers after 10 showings.

<br>**When one of these conditions is met, it’s time to consider lowering your price or upgrading your home.** If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
