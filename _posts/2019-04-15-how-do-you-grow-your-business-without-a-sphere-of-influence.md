If you move to a new area and you don’t know a lot of people from there, how can you use that to get business?

Well, I’d say that your sphere of influence is still a good avenue; you just have an extra step to take. **If you don’t have a sphere of influence currently, your goal should be to create one.** Instead of making the goal to talk to five people in your sphere, you’d instead need to make the goal to add five people to your sphere.

At one time, I wasn’t involved with sales in any way, shape, or form. I had a Facebook, but that wasn’t even a huge deal for me. So what did I do to grow my sphere?&nbsp;

For one, door knocking is one way to build up your database. I know that the idea may spook some of you, but don’t worry—that’s not the only way. Door knocking, however, is still useful. When someone answers the door, ask them, “Do you have anyone you can talk to about your real estate questions?” If they say no, then they may want to be in your database if you can provide value to them.

You can also find businesspeople who want to form a reciprocal relationship with you in which you exchange referrals for referrals.

Hosting networking events is another way to grow your database. Meet with people in restaurants to have discussions about the kinds of value you can provide each other.

Open houses are not only a great way to meet new people, but also to find new business.

**Ultimately, I would say that business is everywhere—you just need to focus on building your sphere.** Try adding at least five new people a week if you don’t already have 200 people in your database. Even if you have 100 people who know, like, and trust you, you still need to focus on growing your database because the more you stay in touch with them, the more they’ll see you as an expert in real estate. The more people recognize your expertise, the more business you’ll have.
