<center>Need to find an agent in another area for a client? Here&rsquo;s how you do it.</center>

&nbsp;

When you have a client or friend in another city, state, or even country, how do you find them a real estate agent?&nbsp;

If I don’t have a referral myself, **I begin by speaking to people I already know who, in turn, may know someone great in that area.** I may meet people at virtual trainings, conferences, and more. Then, if I still can’t get a good recommendation, I’ll start calling brokerages to find out who works in that specific area.&nbsp;

However, I don’t just stop at one agent; I interview them the way I expect clients to interview me. You should ask them how they service their clients and communicate with them, and make sure it aligns with how you run your business. Your clients are going to be expecting the same level of service from the other Realtor that they get from you. We all know there are lousy real estate agents everywhere; you don’t want to recommend one of those.&nbsp;

**Ensure you’re referring a professional.** Don’t ask if they specialize in X area. Instead, ask where most of their houses sell. This will be a better indicator of the areas in which they specialize.&nbsp;

You can also utilize technology; Keller Williams has a platform where you can see where everyone’s sales occurred, and this helps you see who sells the most properties in a certain area. However, I still interview them—don’t simply go with who sells the most homes. I want to ensure my clients are having an excellent experience.

If you have further questions about finding a referral agent or real estate in general, please call or email me at tiffany@fykesgroup.com. I would love to help you.&nbsp;
