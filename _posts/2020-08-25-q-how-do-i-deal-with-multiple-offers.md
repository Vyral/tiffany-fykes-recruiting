<center>What&rsquo;s the trick to dealing with multiple offers in our competitive market?</center>

&nbsp;

There are three things you can do as a real estate agent to keep a competitive edge in our marketplace:

1. **Communicate with the listing agent.** Let them know how excited your buyers are to purchase their property, and let them know where your client is in terms of financing. Also, clue them into other things about you and your client, like how easy you are to work with and how professional your team is.
2. **Look at every piece of the offer.** Ask the other agent what their sellers want to see. Do they want to stay in the home for a certain amount of time after closing? Do they want to close quickly, or do they want a lot of time?
3. **Be prepared to make adjustments.** Your client may need to make adjustments to the offer if they want it to get accepted, &nbsp;so help them prepare for that possibility.

At the end of the day, your job is to help your client get the house they want. Follow these tips to make sure that the offer is airtight and amenable to the seller, and get it to them quickly—you do *not* want to be the last to submit an offer. When I get multiple offers that are the same, I’ll judge them based on when they were submitted to me.&nbsp;
