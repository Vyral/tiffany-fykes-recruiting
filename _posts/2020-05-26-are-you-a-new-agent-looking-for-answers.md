<center>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about our upcoming program for new agents.&nbsp;</center>

&nbsp;

It's no secret that COVID-19 has turned our world upside down, and I feel for the new real estate agents who are not only trying to figure out a new industry but also navigate a new and unknown world.

I earned my real estate license back in 2009 after the market crashed, so I know how hard it is to enter into a changing real estate landscape.

Even though I don't have experience in figuring out a whole new career and life during a pandemic, I am committed to bringing us together to craft an actionable plan. That’s why **I’m excited to introduce our New Agent Accelerator Program, the aim of which is to answer the big questions facing real estate professionals right now**—questions like, “How do we still help buyers and sellers during this time?” and, “How do we find business in this new world?”&nbsp;

This will be a free digital event for agents of any brokerage who have been licensed for a year or less. **[You can sign up here](https://newagentaccelerator.eventbrite.com) for the Accelerator Program event on May 27 from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. (space is limited).&nbsp;**

My goal is for you to leave with two things you can do that will dramatically impact your business for the better.&nbsp;

I look forward to seeing you\! In the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email if you have any questions regarding this or real estate in general.&nbsp;
