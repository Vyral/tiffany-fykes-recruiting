Newly licensed agents often feel lost when they first enter the industry, and given that all it takes to become a Realtor is a few hours of training and a test, it’s no wonder why. You may understand what being an agent looks like on paper, but putting your skills as a Realtor to the test in the real world is an entirely different ballgame.&nbsp;

So, **what’s the first thing new agents need to learn?** It’s simple: You need to learn how to find business. This skill will be invaluable to your future success.&nbsp;

Of course, you can’t get by on this knowledge alone. You still need to know how to price homes, how to interpret paperwork, and many other tricks of the trade in order to thrive in this business. Still, none of those skills will matter if you don’t have leads to use them on. I believe in this idea so strongly, in fact, that new **agents on my team spend their first 30 days solely focused on learning how to find business.** Until they’ve perfected this skill, we take care of all the other steps.
