How do you pick the best database management system?

There are a lot of follow-up methods out there you’ll hear about. Once you get your real estate license, everybody starts putting their hands out and asking for your money. There will be many solutions presented to you, but the reality is that **you do need some way to stay organized.** Does it have to be the most expensive database management system, though? Absolutely not.

When I first started as an agent, I used index cards to label my leads. Not because computers didn’t exist (I’m not that old 😁), but because I tend to get distracted on computers. If I have a box of cards in front of me, however, I’m not distracted. All I’m focused on is calling the names on those cards and following up with them.&nbsp;

I stored all of my index cards in a folder, separated them by month, and moved them around manually. After I finished one month’s worth of cards, I’d move them into whatever date I needed to follow up with them next. If I got a lead I met at an open house, for example, I’d schedule them for the next month or keep them in the same month. It can be that simple\!

You can also get a computerized database management system, which your brokerage may offer. Remember, though, that you don’t need to pay more than $10 a month for this type of system. When I eventually switched to a computerized system (after you have 100+ people in your system, you need to upgrade), I paid $9 for it and it worked just fine. All I had to do was set automatic reminders and it would tell me who to call each day.&nbsp;

The bottom line is this: **The best database in the world is the one you’ll use.** Don’t get hung up on the tools involved—just start following up consistently. That’s where you’ll find success.
