One of the things I focus on heavily is how to fit my appointments into business work hours. I know that not every showing can necessarily fit into that time frame, but I’ve figured out an easy way to keep almost all of my appointments confined to my working hours. People often ask me how I’m able to manage this, so I’d like to share my simple process with you today.

One of the things I love to provide people with is my appointment-setting script. When setting appointments, I learned that if you don't give clients any options, they’ll pick whatever is easiest for them. Easiest for them usually winds up being in the evening time.

**My initial strategy was to offer my clients a choice of either 1 p.m. or 3 p.m.** This worked about 70% of the time, but I would still get people who’d say that those times didn’t work for them; they either wanted a morning or an evening appointment.

So **I adjusted my script a little bit and began offering clients an additional choice to meet over lunch.** That ended up eliminating 95% of evening appointments.

Now, there are still some people who just cannot make those time frames work. Nurses or police officers, for example, will find it hard to make those appointments since they have such strict schedules. **In those cases, I offered to set appointments for 1 p.m. or 3 p.m. on Saturday, since that worked for my home life.**

No matter what, be flexible with your script. Give your clients two options to choose from and then an alternative for those who just can’t make your initial options work. That’s how you serve your clients well and maintain your schedule.

If you have any other questions about balancing work and home life or about being an agent in general, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
