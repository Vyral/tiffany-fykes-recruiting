<center>Here are three books that I think every real estate agent should read.</center>

&nbsp;

I was recently asked which books I think are essential reading for real estate agents. That was such a hard question for me—I can think of at least 45 books that agents would benefit from digesting. Today, however, I’ll just choose the three that our team has read, and then two bonus books because picking only three was so difficult.

1. **“The Millionaire Real Estate Agent,” by Gary Keller, Dave Jenks, and Jay Papasan.** I read this book seven times in my first year in the industry because there’s just so much information about how to build your business, how to get in the right mindset, how to do the mechanical aspects of being an agent, and more.
2. **“Fanatical Prospecting,” by Jeb Blount.** This is an older book about sales; I didn’t get into this business with a wealth of sales knowledge, and neither did many people on our team. “Fanatical Prospecting” provides tips and guidance on how to master sales conversations, fill up your pipeline, leverage social selling, and more.**Bonus book: “Ninja Selling,” by Larry Kendall.** This book might seem like it contradicts some of what you’ll read in “Fanatical Prospecting,” but I don’t think they are actually contradictory at all. You simply need to take the things that work for you from each of them and then use those points to create your prospecting plan.
3. **“The ONE Thing,” by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan.** This isn’t a real estate-specific book, but rather, it’s about learning how your brain works, how to set goals, and how to achieve them. It’s a little book, but it’s powerful.**Bonus book: “Fierce Conversations,” by Susan Scott.** This another book for humans in general; it’s all about how to communicate with people in a positive, healthy way. Real estate is all about communication, so if you become more skilled at that, you’ll be more successful.

If you have any questions or would like any more recommendations on must-read books for agents, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to share more examples of literature that can help you be the best agent you can be.
