If you’re thinking of entering the real estate industry, you’re probably wondering if now is a good time to do so. Actually, yes. Let me explain why by sharing a little bit of information about my own experience.

I entered the real estate industry in 2009—when the market hit its bottom. However, despite the fact that the economy was in decline, my team’s business more than doubled for three years straight after I got on board.

**With this in mind, it’s always a good time to get in real estate.** The right question isn’t when you should enter the industry, it’s how.

Being successful as a real estate professional is all about having a strong work ethic. You’ve got to hit the ground running. You must also realize that once you’ve cracked into real estate, you’re actually entering two distinct businesses: the lead generation business and the service business. **To be successful, you’ll need to master both of these.**

Being skilled in these two businesses will ensure your success regardless of market conditions. While a slower market will require greater emphasis on service, a more fast-paced market will require a strong grasp on lead generation.

So, again, there is no bad time to enter into the world of real estate. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
