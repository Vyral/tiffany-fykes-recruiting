<center>I believe every real estate agent should be investing in real estate. Here&rsquo;s why.</center>

&nbsp;

One of the things that always astounds me is how few real estate agents own real estate as investments. I am passionate about making sure every agent, no matter their level, is investing in real estate. If you aren’t investing in real estate, you should be. Why is real estate investing important?&nbsp;

Real estate is a wonderful asset\! **Real estate you own is an asset that appreciates and creates cash flow.** Your tenants’ rent money will help pay off the debt from your purchase. You’re making money in three different ways on just one investment.&nbsp;

As a Realtor, you should be aware of a great deal when you see one, you should be investing in what you know. Stockbrokers have insight into stocks, and real estate agents have insight into real estate. I believe you should put aside a little of every commission you make toward your first down payment on an investment property.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about investing in real estate, please reach out to me via phone or email. I would love to help you\!&nbsp;
