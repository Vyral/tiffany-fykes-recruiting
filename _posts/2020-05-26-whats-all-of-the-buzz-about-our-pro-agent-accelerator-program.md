<center>Here&rsquo;s what our awesome Accelerator program can do for you.&nbsp;</center>

&nbsp;

I hope you’re having a great day (who knows how many it's been since the world was "normal”).&nbsp;&nbsp;

I want to let you know about our upcoming Pro Agent Accelerator Program and the benefit to you. I entered the real estate world in 2009 when the market was crashing and everything was unknown. **But our current situation is a different kind of unknown;** not only are these abnormal market cycles we’re experiencing, but everything we knew about our family dynamics and how we run our businesses has changed.&nbsp;

While I have 10 years of experience to lean on to get me through difficult situations, I don't have all of the answers. **That’s why I am inviting you to a free digital event where we, as Realtors, can plan together for this unknown era and come out a little bit stronger**.&nbsp;

Agents from any brokerage are welcome. You can **sign up here** for the Accelerator on May 28 from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. Space is limited, so act quickly.&nbsp;

My goal is for you to leave with two actionable items that you can implement in your business.

I look forward to seeing you\! In the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions. I’m always here to help.&nbsp;
