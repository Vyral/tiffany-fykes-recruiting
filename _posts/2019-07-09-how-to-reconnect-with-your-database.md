No matter if you’ve been in the real estate business for two, five, or 12 years, staying in touch with the people you know, or your **sphere of influence**, is an instrumental part of your continued success.&nbsp;

If you’ve been an agent for any number of years and you aren’t doing this, don’t panic: **Today I’ll start you on the right track to keeping in touch with your sphere.&nbsp;**

In the first few years of my real estate career, I made the mistake that so many other agents make. I had gotten so busy that I wasn’t staying in touch with the people who knew, liked, and trusted me and who I had done business with in the past.&nbsp;

I quickly learned that **once you grow outside your circle of intimate friends, family, and neighbors, you must have a system in place that fosters communication with your sphere. &nbsp;**

If you don’t have your own system, now’s the time to develop one. First, **send a letter to the people in your sphere apologizing to them for how you’ve neglected to stay in touch and assure them that you plan to turn it around.** Then, let them know that you plan to call sometime in the following week.

Now, some of us have hundreds of people in our databases, and calling them all in a single week wouldn’t feasibly produce meaningful conversations. So, I sent out a letter each week to a certain number of people in my database while also creating a call list that consisted of those specific people.&nbsp;

When making my initial calls, one noteworthy thing I did was leave real estate out of the conversation. I instead used that time to apologize again and ask questions in order to update the existing information in my database. The conversation should be less about business and more about socializing—unless the person welcomes talk of real estate, at which point you can lend your expertise.&nbsp;

After your call, **write a handwritten note to each person you spoke with, and in that note, ask for a referral or an introduction to someone they might know who will be in the market to buy or sell a home soon.** From there, you can begin to shift your conversations toward real estate. &nbsp;

Just to recap everything:&nbsp;

**1\. Send people in your sphere an apology letter&nbsp;<br>2\. Give them a call and have a non-real estate conversation&nbsp;<br>3\. Send a handwritten letter asking for referrals<br>4\. Make them part of your new high-touch system**

If you have any questions about developing a system whereby you stay in touch with your sphere or about improving your business in general, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d be happy to have a conversation with you\!&nbsp;
