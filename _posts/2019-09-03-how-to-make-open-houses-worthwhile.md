People often say that open houses don’t sell properties—they sell agents. However, while open houses are definitely a great opportunity for agents to meet new people and spread the word about their business, they can (and should) benefit the seller, as well.&nbsp;

So what’s the key to making open houses worthwhile for everyone?&nbsp;

First, realize that **open houses are only as good as the number of people coming through the property.** You will, therefore, need to have a strong strategy in place for attracting interested buyers. On our team, we start by making 100 calls and door knocking at 50 to 100 nearby homes in the week leading up to the open house. We also find it helps to take the time to connect with the homeowners of properties that neighbor our open house. Giving them our card and letting them know that you’d be happy to help if a car ends up blocking their driveway, for example, makes a great impression.&nbsp;

Another way we set ourselves apart is by asking people permission to place open house signs in their yard. The vast majority of agents will simply stick signs wherever they feel like, so taking a more courteous approach is sure to help you garner a positive reputation among local homeowners.

Speaking of signs, make sure you put up 20 or so, taking care to place them at major thoroughfares and other well-traveled areas. Then, on the morning of the open house, tying balloons to your signs is a great way to make them stand out even more.&nbsp;

**And don’t forget about digital marketing.** Post about the open house on your Facebook, your business page, and also on Nextdoor, as well as any other social media platforms you happen to use for your business.&nbsp;

Once you’ve attracted adequate interest and the day of the open house arrives, your real work begins. You should wait by the door and greet everyone who comes inside, and then continue to make yourself available to anyone who has further questions or comments during the event. Also, be sure to ask for them to provide their contact information on a sign-up sheet when they come in. This will help you keep in touch with them later on. In fact, the final step agents should take when hosting an open house is to **call or text all the new contacts they’ve made to thank them for coming.**&nbsp;

The important thing is that you are proactive in making connections. An open house should benefit both you and the seller.&nbsp;
