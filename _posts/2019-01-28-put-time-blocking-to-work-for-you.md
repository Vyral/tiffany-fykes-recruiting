As a real estate professional and mom of two, I’ve got a lot on my plate. So how do I do it? How do I manage my time?

The answer is simple: I treat time like money. **Every Sunday, I get out my calendar and develop a budget for my time that week.** I block out each day into sections dedicated to various activities. This way, I know exactly how each moment will be spent before I come to it.

Picking up my kids and attending meetings are two of the most prominent activities within my schedule, but something else that takes up a lot of my time is planning. That’s right, **I actually set aside time in my day to focus on planning out future activities.**

To keep all of these time blocks straight, I like to set up alerts that will remind me of what I’ve got planned. I put my calendar to work for me.

Of course, **it’s also important to schedule in some designated downtime.** There should always be some extra time available in your day in case something unexpected comes up. Life doesn’t always fit neatly within our plans, so this final tip is definitely key to maintaining a realistic schedule.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to see how I’ve set up my calendar for yourself, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
